# Weird Space thingy

This is a simple demo heavily inspired by this [Pico8]() example I [found on twitter]().

Just run a local server in this folder (e.g. `serve .`).

You can see the engine in action [here](https://kitanga.github.io/weird-3d-thing/).

## File structure

If you want to learn how this is done, use only the `index.js` and the `main.js`.

`index.js` holds the initialization code (canvas setup, dom manipulation, and the actual starting of render), whilst the `main.js` holds the util functions and other functions used by `index.js`.

**WARNING**: The code is heavily uncommented, read at your own peril!!
